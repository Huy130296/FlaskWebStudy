Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app
# Virtual Machine
    * Costs: Deploying a CMS application on a VM is more expensive
    * Scalability + Availability: High availability, scalability, and redundancy by clustering multiple virtual machines.There are two options when it comes to scalingâ€”Virtual Machine Scale Sets and Load Balancers.
    * Workflow: 
        - Easily create a virtual machine on the page
        - Deploying on a virtual machine requires many operations, and each deployment has to repeat some of the previous operations, contributing to slow application             updates.
# App Service
    * Costs: Deploying an application CMS is cheaper. Even free at some low levels
    * Scalability + Availability: High availability, auto-scaling(Vertical or Horizontal scaling)
    * Workflow:
        - Easily create a app service on the page
        - Deploying a CMS application on App Service with github makes app updates quick and requires only one-time configuration
* I chose the Application Service solution to deploy the application because of its low cost, not much care about the infrastructure but focused on the application, easy   to deploy the application
